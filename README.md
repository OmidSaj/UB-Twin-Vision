## Introduction
This is the official repository for the code and models used by UB-SHM team in IC-SHM 2021, project 2. Models are evalauted on the [QuakeCity](https://sail.cive.uh.edu/quakecity/) benchmark dataset. The following models are introduced for 

| Name | Segmentation Task | Trained Model |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| SRT-Net | Component type | link |
| SRT-Net | Component damage severity | link |
| DmgFormer-S | Cracks, rebar exposure, spalling | link |
| DmgFormer-L | Cracks, rebar exposure, spalling | link |
