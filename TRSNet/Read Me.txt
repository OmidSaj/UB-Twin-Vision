Please make to install the packages provided in Anaconda_env/torch19.yml file (anaconda envrionemnt)

Every Task has three files. The three files have the same identifier for the task, the decoder, encoder, etc, but with different ending.
A regular file for training (ends with _cont.py), a file for testing on our test set (ends with _test.py), a file for producing Kaggle files (ends with _generate_kaggle_labels.py) 

Make sure that "hr_name" variable matches the checkpoint for testing and producing Kaggle files.

Also, check these two lines to make sure the weights file match the one in "weights" folder
"""
checkpoint = torch.load(f'{weights_dir}/{hr_name}/{model_name}_loss_checkpoint.pt')
best_model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)
"""

If there are any bugs, please email keltouny@buffalo.edu or ssajedi@buffalo.edu
